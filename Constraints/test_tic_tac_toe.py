"""
Youâ€™re playing a two-player paper-and-pencil game, where players take turns marking a three-by-three grid with either an "x" or an "o." The objective is to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
The winner gains 1 point, while the loser loses 1 point.
Assuming "e" represents empty, the current board state is: 
e | o | e
e | x | o
x | x | o
The next move is "x" 

The game tree could be generated as follows:
"x" can place the mark on (0,0), (0,2) and (1,0).
If "x" places the mark on (0,0), 
   "o" can then place the mark on (0,2) and (1,0).
   If "o" places the mark on (0,2), "o" wins.
   If "o" places the mark on (1,0), 
      "x" can then place the mark on (0,2), 
      If "x" places the mark on (0,2), "x" wins.
If "x" places the mark on (0,2), "x" wins.
If "x" places the mark on (1,0), 
   "o" can then place the mark on (0,0) and (0,2).
   If "o" places the mark on (0,0), 
      "x" can then place the mark on (0,2), 
      If "x" places the mark on (0,2), "x" wins.
   If "o" places the mark on (0,2), "o" wins.
